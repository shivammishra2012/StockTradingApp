# StockTradingApp
An Online Stock Brokerage System facilitates its users the trade (i.e. buying and selling) of stocks online. It allows clients to keep track of and execute their transactions, and shows performance charts of the different stocks in their portfolios. It also provides security for their transactions and alerts them to pre-defined levels of changes in stocks, without the use of any middlemen.

The online stock brokerage system automates traditional stock trading using computers and the internet, making the transaction faster and cheaper. This system also gives speedier access to stock reports, current market trends, and real-time stock prices.

System Requirements
We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the online stock brokerage system:

Any user of our system should be able to buy and sell stocks.
Any user can have multiple watchlists containing multiple stock quotes.
Users should be able to place stock trade orders of the following types: 1) market, 2) limit, 3) stop loss and, 4) stop limit.
Users can have multiple ‘lots’ of a stock. This means that if a user has bought a stock multiple times, the system should be able to differentiate between different lots of the same stock.
The system should be able to generate reports for quarterly updates and yearly tax statements.
Users should be able to deposit and withdraw money either via check, wire, or electronic bank transfer.
The system should be able to send notifications whenever trade orders are executed.
